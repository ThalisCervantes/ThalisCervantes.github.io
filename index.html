 <h2> About this service </h2>
  
   <p>
This service was created as the first application to use a new RPC mechanism designed in the Computer Laboratory - MSRPC2. It runs over MSNL (Multi-Service Network Layer) - a network layer protocol designed for ATM networks. 
  </p>
  
  <p>A video capture board in an Acorn Archimedes grabs one frame every second and the WWW server requests a frame from it using MSRPC2 (indirectly). Each frame is JPEG encoded by the Archimedes.</p>

    The online coffee pot actually predates our World Wide Web server by some time. If you want to know how it all came about, take a look at its (non-technical)<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000229201823/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/qsf/coffee.html"> biography</a>.

    Una de las ventajas de las p√°ginas feas es que puedes ponerles lo que sea:
    
    <ul>
      <li> The lights in the Trojan Room aren't always switched on, but we try to leave a small lamp pointing at the coffee pot so you can see it at night.</li>
      <li> Apart from the fares to get here, you need to be a member of the coffee club before partaking.</li>  
    </ul>

    <h4>Local radio report</h4>
    
     <p> 
    On 11th November 1994, we were visited by a reporter from our local radio station, BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, to make a report on this service. Naturally we connected a radio to one of our workstations and relayed the broadcast over our local network. The transmission was also recorded digitally, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000816022627/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/report1994-11-11.au"> you can hear it too</a> (1.5Mb, 3'20").
  </p>
    
    <p>We are grateful to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire for giving permission to put this audio file on the Web.</p>
